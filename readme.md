## Enpass Exported JSON to LastPass accepted CSV

LastPass as of now doesn't accept JSON/CSV generated by Enpass, which stops much of the adoption to LastPass from those using Enpass.

This application is to bridge the gap and make it easy to convert the exported files for interoperability. This repo is written in abstract and composable structure to ensure future changes are quickly adoptable.

---
LastPass CSV structure is obtained from [docs](https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass/help/how-do-i-import-stored-data-into-lastpass-using-a-generic-csv-file).

Accepted headers are: `name, fav, url, username, password, extra, grouping`

---

#### Usage:
```
    PYTHONPATH=. python3 main/LastPassFileGenerator.py -i <absolute path to enpass expoted json>
```

Find the converted csv in `output` folder in `main` directory.

*Example*: 
`PYTHONPATH=. python3 main/LastPassFileGenerator.py  -i /Users/Name/enpass_json_to_lastpass_csv/test/fixture/sample.json`
